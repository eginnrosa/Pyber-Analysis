# Pyber-Analysis
An analysis of simulated ride-sharing data, using python, pandas, and matplotlib.

The dataset is comprised of a complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type. Visualization were built to show relationships between these details, including average number of rides by city, average fare by city, number of drivers by city, and trends based on city type. Three key observations from the data were noted, and visualizations and the merged dataset were exported.

Analysis presented via a Jupyter notebook.
